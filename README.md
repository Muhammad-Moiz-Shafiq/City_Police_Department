# City Police Department - My Database Systems project
  This was my 2nd semester. The motivation behind this project idea was my passion and respect 
  for Law Enforcement authorities.
    
# Collaborator: Muhammad Haseeb ul Haq
  Haseeb is my class-fellow and we did this project together in a group. We completed this project within 7 days, 
  which was a good experience for me. Haseeb is a good programmer and a great problem solver.
